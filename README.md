# Code Retreat

You'll find here materials that we have developed at [ENX](https://euranova.eu)
to facilitate [code retreat](http://coderetreat.org).

## Scaffolds

When you're not comfortable with a language, it might take you a lot of time
to scaffold the minimum and start right away. This is a pity!

We provide a scaffold allowing you to start to write code and practice Test
Driven Development quickly for the following programming languages:

* [Bash](scaffolds/bash/README.md)
* [Clojure](scaffolds/clojure/README.md)
* [JavaScript](scaffolds/javascript/README.md)
* [Python](scaffolds/python/README.md)
* [Ruby](scaffolds/ruby/README.md)
* [Rust](scaffolds/rust/README.md)
* [C#](scaffolds/csharp/README.md)
