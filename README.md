# Code Retreat

You'll find here materials that we have developed at [ENX](https://euranova.eu)
to facilitate [code retreat](http://coderetreat.org).

## TCR

`test && commit || revert` is a practice invented by Kent Beck.

We provide scripts to use TCR with the scaffolds:
* `./scripts/tcr`: the classic version.
* `./scripts/btcr`: this script is easier to work with: build failures will **not**
  be reverted, giving you a chance to fix them.

## Scaffolds

When you're not comfortable with a language, it might take you a lot of time
to scaffold the minimum and start right away. This is a pity!

We provide a scaffold allowing you to start to write code and practice Test
Driven Development quickly for the following programming languages:

* [Bash](scaffolds/bash/README.md)
* [Clojure](scaffolds/clojure/README.md)
* [C++](scaffolds/cpp/README.md)
* [C#](scaffolds/csharp/README.md)
* [Java](scaffolds/java/README.md)
* [JavaScript](scaffolds/javascript/README.md)
* [PHP](scaffolds/php/README.md)
* [Python](scaffolds/python/README.md)
* [Ruby](scaffolds/ruby/README.md)
* [Rust](scaffolds/rust/README.md)
* [Scala](scaffolds/scala/README.md)
* [Swift](scaffolds/swift/README.md)
